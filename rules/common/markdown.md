# Markdown & Docsify

- ATX headings (`#`), not setext. One blank line before headings.
- Docsify sites: `_sidebar.md` for navigation, `_coverpage.md` for landing.
- Use `{docsify-ignore}` to exclude headings from sidebar, `{docsify-ignore-all}` for entire files.
- Fenced code blocks with language identifier. No indented code blocks.
- Tables for structured data (schedules, grading rubrics, resource lists).
- Relative links between docs. Anchor links for in-page navigation.
- Keep lesson plans scannable: learning objectives up top, resources at bottom.
- No trailing whitespace. One newline at end of file.
